Import &amp; Animate

Your fourth assignment is to study the Unity animation and asset importing pipelines.
------
1. Watch the following tutorial video:
https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/animation/animation-view?playlist=17099
2. Read the following manual pages:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ImportingAssets.html
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-ArtAssetBestPracticeGuide.html
3. Create a new Unity project/scene. In that scene, import a 3D model. Where this
model is, or who made it, is not important – it just can’t be a simple 3D primitive.
Bring the imported model into your scene. Attach an animator to the model instance.
Create an animator controller, assign it to the model animator, and create a looping
animation that smoothly moves the model over time. How the model moves is up to you;
the motion just needs to be obvious. The animation should play and loop automatically
when the scene is played.

___________________________________
If you’re confused about animators or animator controllers, look at the Unity documentation.
Part of this assignment is practicing problem-solving with the resources available to you. Ask
questions on the Unity forums, or email me.


If you’ve worked with animators in Unity before, this assignment should be simple. The motion
of the animation does not need to be thorough or accurate; it just needs to move so that I can
see you know how to create a simple functioning animator component.
